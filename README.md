# Project: Investigate a Dataset(no-show appointments)
# By Abid Mohamed Nadhir

# Summary

I have chosen this dataset for no-show appointments this dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. One remark in the description of this dataset is the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not. This dataset’s major records were taken in May and some others in March and April. The dataset is a good example of data cleaning and data analysis.

# Questions about Dataset

* What is the relation between the date and showing for the appointment?
* What are the percentage records in each month?
* What is the relation between the age and showing for the appointment?
* How age is distributed in the dataset?
* Is showing for the appointment related to some time in the day rather than another?
* What is the percentage of scholarship holders in this dataset?
* What is the relation between scholarship and attendance?
